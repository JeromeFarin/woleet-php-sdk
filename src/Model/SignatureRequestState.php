 * @description State of the signature request.&lt;br&gt; If not set, the signature request is **stateless** and can be updated at any time (eg. to add new signers on the fly).&lt;br&gt; If set to &#x27;DRAFT&#x27; at creation time, the signature request is **stateful** and its state can be transitioned using the dedicated endpoint.&lt;br&gt; Available states:&lt;br&gt; - &#x60;DRAFT&#x60;: the signature request is being edited (only &#x60;DRAFT&#x60; signature requests can be updated)&lt;br&gt; - &#x60;PENDING&#x60;: the signature request is awaiting for its activation date&lt;br&gt; - &#x60;IN_PROGRESS&#x60;: the activation date has been reached, the signature request emails have been sent to the signers (if applicable) and the signatures are being collected&lt;br&gt; - &#x60;COMPLETED&#x60;: all signatures have been collected&lt;br&gt; - &#x60;CLOSED&#x60;: the signature request has been closed by the owner before all signatures could be collected&lt;br&gt; - &#x60;CANCELED&#x60;: the signature request has been canceled by the owner before all signatures could be collected&lt;br&gt; - &#x60;EXPIRED&#x60;: the deadline of the signature request has been reached before all signatures could be collected
